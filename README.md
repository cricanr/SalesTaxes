Thoughtworks Code Challenge
PROBLEM TWO: SALES TAXES
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt. 
Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.

When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items,
and the total amounts of sales taxes paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains 
(np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.

Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping baskets...

Design
Problem is broken down into 3 classes

Lineitem
Receipt
Output
LineItem breaks down the input and organize each line item by quantity, price and product. The class also takes into consideration goods that are exempt from sales tax(10%), and all imported goods, which are taxed 5%.

Receipt takes an input, calculates the appropriate tax for each line item, and prints it.
